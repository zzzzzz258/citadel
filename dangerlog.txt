Mocky test:
I can only receive mocky responses by connect method, this makes it unhelpful for cache tests.

Cache test:
I couldn't find a website with no-cache in response. And I couldn't find a website with Expire but without max-age. These leave two branches not tested.

Robust to failures:
For our methods, we achieve strong gaurantee. We catch every error in send() and recv(), print error message in log file and exit its method gracefully.
